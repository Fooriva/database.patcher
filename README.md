Mouf's database patching system
===============================

This package is a database patch system designed for [Mouf](http://mouf-php.com) than enables developers to know what patch has been run and what needs to be run on its environment.
If you are working with a team or with many environment, this is very useful to know which database patches have been applied or not in an environment.

This is an extension (and the main implementation) of Mouf's patcher system.
